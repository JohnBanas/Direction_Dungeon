# Direction_Dungeon
_A simple "choose your own adventure" style terminal game._

My first Python application and my first time using PyCharm. Direction Dungeon lets you choose your path to freedom from the dungeon with simple input response in the terminal. 

## How it works
As the user you are prompted with direction choices. After you choose a direction you are presented with a new piece of information to your story, which will indicate one of two scenarios:

- A new choice to make
- The end of the game

The end of the game comes with an option to start again if you wish. The directions chosen give random results every time so that the path out of the dungeon is random, if you make it out at all... ;)
